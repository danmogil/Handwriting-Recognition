# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Handwriting Recognition

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Using supervised learning, my program will identify single digits (1-9).

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The data comes from the public MNIST database. First steps include decoding the training data (encoding information detailed on the MNIST site). I will use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) supervised learning (SL) model. The input layer will consist of 784 ANs (representing pixels). I don't want to go too deep into how ANNs work in this writing assignment, but the goal is to adjust ANs' connection weights to ultimately fire the correct AN in the output layer. The output layer consists of 9 ANs (1-9). Weights will be read from and written to a text file. Ultimately, the program will make predictions from data that was not used during training. The user will be shown the image (as "ASCII art") and the program's prediction.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The program will make predictions based on training knowledge (> 1/9 accuracy).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Said predictions will be accurate (> 80%).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Ability to accuratly predict user uploaded handwritten numerical images (with proper conditions). However, for the training data to be relevant, user uploaded images must be processed to meet MNIST specs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

This project will advance my skills in Java and the mathematics behinds ANNs. I have researched ANNs in the past, but have yet to implement them. Next steps are outlined in prior responses.
