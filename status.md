Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have decoded the training data (IDX format) and converted said data to an accessible datatype (int[]). I am working on a function to initialize (if not present) a file containing the starting weights for all AN connections. Additionally, images can be depicted through an ASCii art format. I plan to display the image in said format along with the program's prediction.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Once this file is initialized, the network will read and adjust said weights through mathmatical calculations. The file will be rewritten with the appropriate weights once training is complete (error function has stopped decreasing).

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

None
